# Windows on Fridges Web App
Our web application is a simple one-page HTML/JavaScript app that has responsive design and can be used to call the robot to a certain room, cancel the request to a certain room, check on the request status, and submit feedback.
The web-app is to be hosted on Azure and use Azure Mobile Services with SQL database as a backend.

The package also contains a database script that uses SendGrid add-on for Azure to email the feedback to the web app owner (insertFeedbackScript.js).

To find out how to set up this web app, go to http://ms-iot.github.io/windows-on-fridges/webservices/webapp/
